# Ideas for future Development

## Road to first release

- Publish crates / extension
- License for Code
- Smooth onboarding experience for players
- tune the cpu clock speed
- Proper Documentation of device APIs
- handshake for device slot handling to
  allow changes without breaking compatibility
- Local And Server-side simulation:
  Allowing local practicing and async server races
- TrueSkill ranking system
  - every Artifact gets its own rating
    - transferable?
  - Automatically scheduled Races on the server 24/7

## Future Ideas

- Devices take different amounts of time
- Telemetry system
  - Cars can record telemetry up to x kB per race in their memory
  - Player can download that for every participated race
- publish emulator as bevy_riscv crate for others to use
- A honk device
- connector cli as an alternative to vscode extension?
- Replay system?
- Stream races live via Twitch :D
- Throwing the game at an LLM and finding out how good it gets
